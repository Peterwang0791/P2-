Giant pandas have a distinctive black and white coat, with black fur around their eyes and on their ears, muzzle, legs and shoulders. Their thick, wooly coat helps to keep them warm in their cool mountain homes. Adult pandas are about 150cm from nose to rump, with a 10-15cm tail. And they can grow up to 90cm tall at the shoulder.An adult panda can weigh up to 150kg, with males 10% larger and 20% heavier than females.
